# tokentruth

##Description

Lets user submit tokens to be added to a registry, Validators then vote weather or not they beileve the purpose of the token 
is useful or wanted. After validators vote the proposition is either dumped or pushed to the registry, 
adding it without hassle to all the sites using the registery.

Validators MUST be truthful, and verify all the information that is posted... 
Including :
	The Purpose,
	Token Address,
	Decimal information,
	Symbol,
	Token Name,
